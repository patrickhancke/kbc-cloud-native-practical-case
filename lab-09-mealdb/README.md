# (Optional) Lab 09 - MealDB

An optional lab for those with time to spare! At the start of their adventure ``ezGroceries`` identified two APIs:

* https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php
* https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

Due to various reasons the team focussed on the implementation of the ``CocktailDB`` integration, but integration
with ``MealDB`` remained in the back of their minds.

Now the Cocktail functionality is successful we can expand our application and also support meals in our shopping lists.

Basic requirements:

* Add a meal search API (similar to the cocktails one)
* Add the ability to add meals to a shopping list (similar to the cocktails one)
* Return all the distinct ingredients of a Shopping List, extracted from both added cocktails and meals.
